    <h1><strong> Re: Eileen Dover university application</strong></h1><hr>

    <p>Dear Eileen,<br>

      Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
      Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will
      answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>

    <p>
      We are <em>happy</em> to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
      however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a
      semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>First semester:  <time datetime="2016-09-09"> 9 September 2016</time></li>
      <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15"> 15 January 2017</time> </li>
      <li>Third semester:  <time datetime="2017-05-02"> 2 May 2017</time></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would
    prefer. You can find more information about important university dates on
    <a href="https://www.google.com.mx/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=LmmRWKOTKMf58Afs6ZLwBw" title="Visita el sitio web">our website.</a></p>

    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

    <p>
      At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty <em>open-minded</em> research
      facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science
      and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
      just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the
      ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of
      priority:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
        (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures
        exceeding 30&ordm;<abbr title="Celsius">C</abbr> (86&ordm;<abbr title="Fahrenheit">F</abbr>), when the audience size exponentially increases
        (effect of 3 <sup>&#215;</sup>103 increasing to 3 <sup>&#215;</sup> 104.)
      </li>
      <li><abbr title="Lenguaje de Marcas de Hipertexto"> HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Hojas de estilo en cascada">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
      including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and
      other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

    <p>
      Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic
      tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as
      follows, with definitions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Polynesian chicken dance</li>
      <p>
        A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300 <abbr title="Antes de cristo">b.c</abbr>, a
        whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage
        their livestock to be "fruitful".
      </p>

      <li>Icelandic brownian shuffle</li>
      <p>
        Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they
        used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a
        circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
        tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that
        he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
      </p>

      <li>Arctic robot dance</li>
      <p>
        An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in
        the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by
        "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern
        Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were
        just moving like this because they were really cold.
      </p>
    </ul>
